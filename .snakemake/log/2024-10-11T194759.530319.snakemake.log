Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

Error in rule split:
    jobid: 0
    input: shuf.a.bed.gz, shuf.b.bed.gz
    output: split_individual/chr1.bed.gz.bed.gz
    shell:
        
        (zgrep -h '^chr1.bed.gz\b' shuf.a.bed.gz;
         zgrep -h '^chr1.bed.gz\b' shuf.b.bed.gz) |
        gzip > split_individual/chr1.bed.gz.bed.gz
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job split since they might be corrupted:
split_individual/chr1.bed.gz.bed.gz
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
