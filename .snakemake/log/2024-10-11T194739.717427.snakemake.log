Error in rule split:

    output: split_individual/{chr}.bed.gz
    shell:

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job split since they might be corrupted:
split_individual/{chr}.bed.gz
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
