Error in rule split:
    jobid: 0
    input: shuf.a.bed.gz, shuf.b.bed.gz
    output: split/chr3.bed.gz
    shell:
        zgrep -P "^chr3\s" shuf.a.bed.gz | gzip > split/chr3.bed.gzzgrep -P "^chr3\s" shuf.b.bed.gz | gzip >> split/chr3.bed.gz
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job split since they might be corrupted:
split/chr3.bed.gz
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
